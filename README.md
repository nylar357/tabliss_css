## What Are These Files?                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                       
This repository contains various `.css` files, each offering a different visual style or modification for your Tabliss new tab page. You can use them to change colors, fonts, widget layouts, add animations, or make other visual tweaks beyond the standard Tabliss settings.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
## How to Use                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Using these custom styles is straightforward:                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                       
1.  **Choose a Style:** Browse the `.css` files in this repository and decide which one you want to try.                                                                               
2.  **Copy the CSS:** Open the desired `.css` file and copy its entire content.                                                                                                        
3.  **Open Tabliss Settings:** Open a new browser tab (which should load Tabliss) and click the Settings icon (usually a gear ⚙️  located in one of the corners).                      
4.  **Navigate to Custom CSS:** Scroll down within the Tabliss settings panel until you find the **Advanced** section.                                                                 
5.  **Paste the Code:** Paste the CSS code you copied in step 2 into the text box labeled `Custom CSS`.                                                                                
6.  **Apply:** The changes should apply immediately. Close the settings panel.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                       
**To remove a custom style**, simply delete the code from the `Custom CSS` box in the Tabliss settings.
